To run the application:

1.  Open your terminal in the project's root directory (`/Users/sourav/workssss/untitled folder/react-valentine/`).
2.  **Run these commands in order:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the address provided by the `npm start` command).

All Tailwind CSS configurations and files have been removed, and the styling for the application has been reverted to using inline styles within the components. The new interactive flow (Apology, Date Selection, Romantic Card) is still in place.
