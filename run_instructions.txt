To run the application and fix Tailwind CSS loading issue:

1.  Open your terminal in the project's root directory (`/Users/sourav/workssss/untitled folder/react-valentine/`).
2.  **Run these commands in order to clean cache and reinstall dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm cache clean --force
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the address provided by the `npm start` command).

Please try these steps. If Tailwind CSS still isn't loading, let me know, and we can investigate further.
